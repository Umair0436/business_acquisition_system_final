"Johnathan White","Independent","[LOOKUP: Johnathan White @ Independent]","Acquisition Interest: Nashville, TN Opportunities - Acquisition Capital Partners","Dear Johnathan,

My name is John Smith, and I am the Senior Acquisitions Manager at Acquisition Capital Partners. We are a private investment firm actively seeking to acquire established, profitable businesses with a focus on long-term growth and value creation.

Our investment criteria typically target companies with EBITDA ranging from $1M to $5M, particularly within recession-resilient sectors such as B2B services, specialized manufacturing, and recurring revenue models. Geographically, we have a strong interest in the Nashville, TN market and the surrounding regions.

We are keen to explore any off-market opportunities you may be aware of that align with our investment focus. Additionally, we would appreciate being kept informed of any upcoming mandates or businesses you anticipate bringing to market in the near future.

Would you be available for a brief introductory call next week? This would allow us to elaborate on our acquisition strategy and discuss how we might be a strong fit for your clients. Please let me know what time works best for you, or feel free to suggest an alternative.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

John Smith
Senior Acquisitions Manager
