My name is John Smith, and I am the Senior Acquisitions Manager at Acquisition Capital Partners. We are a well-capitalized private investment firm actively seeking to acquire established, profitable businesses.

Our investment mandate focuses on companies with strong management teams, a proven track record, and sustainable cash flows. While we maintain a sector-agnostic approach, we typically target businesses with annual revenues ranging from $5 million to $50 million and EBITDA of $1 million to $10 million. We are particularly interested in opportunities within the North Jackson, OH region, aligning with our strategic geographic focus.

We understand that Independent has an excellent reputation for representing high-quality businesses and often handles unique, confidential mandates. We would be grateful if you would keep Acquisition Capital Partners in mind for any off-market opportunities or upcoming mandates that align with our investment criteria.

I would welcome the opportunity to connect for a brief call or meeting at your earliest convenience. This would allow me to elaborate on our acquisition strategy and discuss how we might be a valuable and efficient partner for your clients seeking a discreet and timely exit.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

John Smith
Senior Acquisitions Manager
